DESCRIBE THE PROJECT...
I’m working on a project using deep learning to analyze multi-dimensional biological imaging data. The dataset is very large and has high-resolution images. I’m requesting an account to leverage powerful compute resources for processing my data and training my deep network models. I want to experiment with a range of different parameters for my models and this will require significant compute resources.

DO YOU PLAN TO USE ANY DATA THAT IS NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE?
Yes

IF YES, PLEASE DESCRIBE ANY AGREEMENTS...
Data is generated by the Fraenkel Lab and free to use by members of the Fraenkel Lab

PLEASE DESCRIBE WHAT HARDWARE,...
I need instances that are configured for high-performance machine learning, like the P3 instance family on AWS. This includes NVIDIA GPUs and options for storing my large imaging datasets. For the software/package requirements, I need a Linux-based operating system, PyTorch, and the following packages: SciKit-Learn, NumPy, SciPy, ScanPy, Pandas, Seaborn, MatPlotLib, and PIL.

DO YOU NEED TO BE ADDED TO ANY GROUPS?
